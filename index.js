// the index.html file has a bunch of h1 and div nodes. They are names and ships. We want a list of ONLY the nodes that have names in them. Nodes with names have an id property that starts with the word "name" such as id="name1". 

// get all the div and h1 nodes and create an array with only the ones that have an id starting with the word "name". 




// hint 1: array.filter is your friend
// hint 2: document.querySelectorAll('selector1, selector2') will get you all nodes that match either selector
